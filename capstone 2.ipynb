       "'I have wished a bird would fly away,\\nAnd not sing by my house all day;\\n\\nHave clapped my hands at him from the door\\nWhen it seemed as if I could bear no more.\\n\\nThe fault must partly have been in me.\\nThe bird was not to blame for his key.\\n\\nAnd of course there must be something wrong\\nIn wanting to silence any song.\\n\\nHe halted in the wind, and — what was that\\nFar in the maples, pale, but not a ghost?\\nHe stood there bringing March against his thought,\\nAnd yet too ready to believe the most.\\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'s the Paradise-in-bloom,\" I said;\\nAnd truly it was fair enough for flowers\\nhad we but in us to assume in march\\nSuch white luxuriance of May for ours.\\n\\nWe stood a moment so in a strange world,\\nMyself as one his own pretense deceives;\\nAnd then I said the truth (and we moved on).\\nA young beech clinging to its last year\\'s leaves.\\n\\nThe farmhouse lingers, though averse to square\\nWith the new city street it has to wear\\nA number in. But what about the brook\\nThat held the house as in an elbow-crook?\\nI ask as one who knew the brook, its strength\\nAnd impulse, having dipped a finger length\\nAnd made it leap my knuckle, having tossed\\nA flower to try its currents where they crossed.\\nThe meadow grass could be cemented down\\nFrom growing under pavements of a town;\\nThe apple trees be sent to hearth-stone flame.\\nIs water wood to serve a brook the same?\\nHow else dispose of an immortal force\\nNo longer needed? Staunch it at its source\\nWith cinder loads dumped down? The brook was thrown\\nDeep in a sewer dungeon under stone\\nIn fetid darkness still to live and run —\\nAnd all for nothing it had ever done\\nExcept forget to go in fear perhaps.\\nNo one would know except for ancient maps\\nThat such a brook ran water. But I wonder\\nIf from its being kept forever under,\\nThe thoughts may not have risen that so keep\\nThis new-built city from both work and sleep.\\n\\nMIST- I don\\'t believe the sleepers in the house know where they are.\\nSMOKE- They\\'ve been here long enough to push the woods back from around the house and part them in the middle with a path.\\nMIST- And still I doubt if they know where they are. And I begin to fear they never will. All they maintain the path for is the comfort of visiting with the equally bewildered. Nearer in plight their neighbors are than distance.\\nSMOKE- I am the guardian wraith of starlit smoke that leans out this and that way from their chimney. I will not have their happiness despaired of.\\nMIST- No one - not I would give them up for lost simply because they don\\'t know where they are.  I am the damper counterpart of smoke that gives off from a garden ground at night. But lifts no higher than a garden grows. I cotton to their landscape. That\\'s who I am. I am no further from their fate than you are\\nSMOKE- They must by now have learned the native tongue. Why don\\'t they ask the red man where they are?\\nMIST - They often do, and none the wiser for it. So do they also ask philosophers who come to look in on them from the pulpit. They will ask anyone there is to ask - In the fond faith accumulated fact - will of itself take fire\\nand light the world up. Learning has been a part of their\\nreligion.\\nSMOKE - If the day ever comes when they know who they are, they may know better where they are. But who they are is too much to believe - either for them or the onlooking world. They are too sudden to be credible.\\nMIST - Listen, they murmur talking in the dark on what\\nshould be their daylong theme continued. Putting the lamp out has not put their thought out. Let us pretend the dewdrops from the leaves are you, and I evesdropping on their unrest - a mist and smoke evesdropping on a haze - And see if we can tell the bass from the soprano.\\nTHAN SMOKE AND MIST WHO BETTER COULD APPRAISE - THE KINDERED SPIRIT OF AN INNER HAZE!\\nSMOKE - If the day ever comes\\n\\nThere sandy seems the golden sky\\nAnd golden seems the sandy plain.\\nNo habitation meets the eye\\nUnless in the horizon rim,\\nSome halfway up the limestone wall,\\nThat spot of black is not a stain\\nOr shadow, but a cavern hole,\\nWhere someone used to climb and crawl\\nTo rest from his besetting fears.\\nI see the callus on his soul\\nThe disappearing last of him\\nAnd of his race starvation slim,\\nOh years ago - ten thousand years.\\n\\nI had withdrawn in forest, and my song\\nWas swallowed up in leaves that blew alway;\\nAnd to the forest edge you came one day\\n(This was my dream) and looked and pondered long,\\nBut did not enter, though the wish was strong:\\nYou shook your pensive head as who should say,\\n‘I dare not—too far in his footsteps stray—\\nHe must seek me would he undo the wrong.\\n\\nNot far, but near, I stood and saw it all\\nBehind low boughs the trees let down outside;\\nAnd the sweet pang it cost me not to call\\nAnd tell you that I saw does still abide.\\nBut \\'tis not true that thus I dwelt aloof,\\nFor the wood wakes, and you are here for proof.\\n\\nOld Davis owned a solid mica mountain\\nIn Dalton that would someday make his fortune.\\nThere\\'d been some Boston people out to see it:\\nAnd experts said that deep down in the mountain\\nThe mica sheets were big as plate-glass windows.\\nHe\\'d like to take me there and show it to me.\\n\\n\\'I\\'ll tell you what you show me. You remember\\nYou said you knew the place where once, on Kinsman,\\nThe early Mormons made a settlement\\nAnd built a stone baptismal font outdoors-\\nBut Smith, or someone, called them off the mountain\\nTo go West to a worse fight with the desert.\\nYou said you\\'d seen the stone baptismal font.\\nWell, take me there.\\'\\n\\nSomeday I will.\\'\\n\\n\\'Today.\\'\\n\\n\\'Huh, that old bathtub, what is that to see?\\nLet\\'s talk about it.\\'\\n\\n\\'Let\\'s go see the place.\\'\\n\\n\\'To shut you up I\\'ll tell you what I\\'ll do:\\nI\\'ll find that fountain if it takes all summer,\\nAnd both of our united strengths, to do it.\\'\\n\\n\\'You\\'ve lost it, then?\\'\\n\\n\\'Not so but I can find it.\\nNo doubt it\\'s grown up some to woods around it.\\nThe mountain may have shifted since I saw it\\nIn eighty-five.\\'\\n\\n\\'As long ago as that?\\'\\n\\n\\'If I remember rightly, it had sprung\\nA leak and emptied then. And forty years\\nCan do a good deal to bad masonry.\\nYou won\\'t see any Mormon swimming in it.\\nBut you have said it, and we\\'re off to find it.\\nOld as I am, I\\'m going to let myself\\nBe dragged by you all over everywhere- \\'\\n\\'I thought you were a guide.\\'\\n\\n\\'I am a guide,\\nAnd that\\'s why I can\\'t decently refuse you.\\'\\n\\nWe made a day of it out of the world,\\nAscending to descend to reascend.\\nThe old man seriously took his bearings,\\nAnd spoke his doubts in every open place.\\n\\nWe came out on a look-off where we faced\\nA cliff, and on the cliff a bottle painted,\\nOr stained by vegetation from above,\\nA likeness to surprise the thrilly tourist.\\n\\n\\'Well, if I haven\\'t brought you to the fountain,\\nAt least I\\'ve brought you to the famous Bottle.\\'\\n\\n\\'I won\\'t accept the substitute. It\\'s empty.\\'\\n\\n\\'So\\'s everything.\\'\\n\\n\\'I want my fountain.\\'\\n\\n\\'I guess you\\'d find the fountain just as empty.\\nAnd anyway this tells me where I am.\\'\\n\\n\\'Hadn\\'t you long suspected where you were?\\'\\n\\n\\'You mean miles from that Mormon settlement?\\nLook here, you treat your guide with due respect\\nIf you don\\'t want to spend the night outdoors.\\nI vow we must be near the place from where\\nThe two converging slides, the avalanches,\\nOn Marshall, look like donkey\\'s ears.\\nWe may as well see that and save the day.\\'\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t donkey\\'s ears suggest we shake our own?\\'\\n\\n\\'For God\\'s sake, aren\\'t you fond of viewing nature?\\nYou don\\'t like nature. All you like is books.\\nWhat signify a donkey\\'s cars and bottle,\\nHowever natural? Give you your books!\\nWell then, right here is where I show you books.\\nCome straight down off this mountain just as fast\\nAs we can fall and keep a-bouncing on our feet.\\nIt\\'s hell for knees unless done hell-for-leather.\\'\\n\\nBe ready, I thought, for almost anything.\\n\\nWe struck a road I didn\\'t recognize,\\nBut welcomed for the chance to lave my shoes\\nIn dust once more. We followed this a mile,\\nPerhaps, to where it ended at a house\\nI didn\\'t know was there. It was the kind\\nTo bring me to for broad-board paneling.\\nI never saw so good a house deserted.\\n\\n\\'Excuse me if I ask you in a window\\nThat happens to be broken, Davis said.\\n\\'The outside doors as yet have held against us.\\nI want to introduce you to the people\\nWho used to live here. They were Robinsons.\\nYou must have heard of Clara Robinson,\\nThe poetess who wrote the book of verses\\nAnd had it published. It was all about\\nThe posies on her inner windowsill,\\nAnd the birds on her outer windowsill,\\nAnd how she tended both, or had them tended:\\nShe never tended anything herself.\\nShe was \\'shut in\\' for life. She lived her whole\\nLife long in bed, and wrote her things in bed.\\nI\\'ll show You how she had her sills extended\\nTo entertain the birds and hold the flowers.\\nOur business first\\'s up attic with her books.\\'\\n\\nWe trod uncomfortably on crunching glass\\nThrough a house stripped of everything\\nExcept, it seemed, the poetess\\'s poems.\\nBooks, I should say!- if books are what is needed.\\nA whole edition in a packing case\\nThat, overflowing like a horn of plenty,\\nOr like the poetess\\'s heart of love,\\nHad spilled them near the window, toward the light\\nWhere driven rain had wet and swollen them.\\nEnough to stock a village library-\\nUnfortunately all of one kind, though.\\nThey bad been brought home from some publisher\\nAnd taken thus into the family.\\nBoys and bad hunters had known what to do\\nWith stone and lead to unprotected glass:\\nShatter it inward on the unswept floors.\\nHow had the tender verse escaped their outrage?\\nBy being invisible for what it was,\\nOr else by some remoteness that defied them\\nTo find out what to do to hurt a poem.\\nYet oh! the tempting flatness of a book,\\nTo send it sailing out the attic window\\nTill it caught wind and, opening out its covers,\\nTried to improve on sailing like a tile\\nBy flying like a bird (silent in flight,\\nBut all the burden of its body song),\\nOnly to tumble like a stricken bird,\\nAnd lie in stones and bushes unretrieved.\\nBooks were not thrown irreverently about.\\nThey simply lay where someone now and then,\\nHaving tried one, had dropped it at his feet\\nAnd left it lying where it fell rejected.\\nHere were all those the poetess\\'s life\\nHad been too short to sell or give away.\\n\\n\\'Take one,\\' Old Davis bade me graciously.\\n\\n\\'Why not take two or three?\\'\\n\\n\\'Take all you want.\\'\\nGood-looking books like that.\\' He picked one fresh\\nIn virgin wrapper from deep in the box,\\nAnd stroked it with a horny-handed kindness.\\nHe read in one and I read in another,\\nBoth either looking for or finding something.\\n\\nThe attic wasps went missing by like bullets.\\n\\nI was soon satisfied for the time being.\\n\\nAll the way home I kept remembering\\nThe small book in my pocket. It was there.\\nThe poetess had sighed, I knew, in heaven\\nAt having eased her heart of one more copy-\\nLegitimately. My demand upon her,\\nThough slight, was a demand. She felt the tug.\\nIn time she would be rid of all her books.\\n\\nA neighbor of mine in the village\\nLikes to tell how one spring\\nWhen she was a girl on the farm, she did\\nA childlike thing.\\n\\nOne day she asked her father\\nTo give her a garden plot\\nTo plant and tend and reap herself,\\nAnd he said, \\'Why not?\\'\\n\\nIn casting about for a corner\\nHe thought of an idle bit\\nOf walled-off ground where a shop had stood,\\nAnd he said, \\'Just it.\\'\\n\\nAnd he said, \\'That ought to make you\\nAn ideal one-girl farm,\\nAnd give you a chance to put some strength\\nOn your slim-jim arm.\\'\\n\\nIt was not enough of a garden\\nHer father said, to plow;\\nSo she had to work it all by hand,\\nBut she don\\'t mind now.\\n\\nShe wheeled the dung in a wheelbarrow\\nAlong a stretch of road;\\nBut she always ran away and left\\nHer not-nice load,\\n\\nAnd hid from anyone passing.\\nAnd then she begged the seed.\\nShe says she thinks she planted one\\nOf all things but weed.\\n\\nA hill each of potatoes,\\nRadishes, lettuce, peas,\\nTomatoes, beets, beans, pumpkins, corn,\\nAnd even fruit trees.\\n\\nAnd yes, she has long mistrusted\\nThat a cider-apple\\nIn bearing there today is hers,\\nOr at least may be.\\n\\nHer crop was a miscellany\\nWhen all was said and done,\\nA little bit of everything,\\nA great deal of none.\\n\\nNow when she sees in the village\\nHow village things go,\\nJust when it seems to come in right,\\nShe says, \\'I know!\\n\\n\\'It\\'s as when I was a farmer...\\'\\nOh never by way of advice!\\nAnd she never sins by telling the tale\\nTo the same person twice.\\n\\nTo think to know the country and now know\\nThe hillside on the day the sun lets go\\nTen million silver lizards out of snow!\\nAs often as I\\'ve seen it done before\\nI can\\'t pretend to tell the way it\\'s done.\\nIt looks as if some magic of the sun\\nLifted the rug that bred them on the floor\\nAnd the light breaking on them made them run.\\nBut if I though to stop the wet stampede,\\nAnd caught one silver lizard by the tail,\\nAnd put my foot on one without avail,\\nAnd threw myself wet-elbowed and wet-kneed\\nIn front of twenty others\\' wriggling speed,-\\nIn the confusion of them all aglitter,\\nAnd birds that joined in the excited fun\\nBy doubling and redoubling song and twitter,\\nI have no doubt I\\'d end by holding none.\\n\\nIt takes the moon for this. The sun\\'s a wizard\\nBy all I tell; but so\\'s the moon a witch.\\nFrom the high west she makes a gentle cast\\nAnd suddenly, without a jerk or twitch,\\nShe has her speel on every single lizard.\\nI fancied when I looked at six o\\'clock\\nThe swarm still ran and scuttled just as fast.\\nThe moon was waiting for her chill effect.\\nI looked at nine: the swarm was turned to rock\\nIn every lifelike posture of the swarm,\\nTransfixed on mountain slopes almost erect.\\nAcross each other and side by side they lay.\\nThe spell that so could hold them as they were\\nWas wrought through trees without a breath of storm\\nTo make a leaf, if there had been one, stir.\\nOne lizard at the end of every ray.\\nThe thought of my attempting such a stray!\\n\\nWhen I go up through the mowing field,\\nThe headless aftermath,\\n   Smooth-laid like thatch with the heavy dew,\\n Half closes the garden path.\\n\\n   And when I come to the garden ground,\\nThe whir of sober birds\\n Up from the tangle of withered weeds\\n Is sadder than any words\\n\\nA tree beside the wall stands bare,\\n But a leaf that lingered brown,\\n   Disturbed, I doubt not, by my thought,\\n Comes softly rattling down.\\n\\n I end not far from my going forth\\n   By picking the faded blue\\nOf the last remaining aster flower\\n To carry again to you.\\n\\nThe line-storm clouds fly tattered and swift.\\n The road is forlorn all day,\\nWhere a myriad snowy quartz stones lift,\\n And the hoof-prints vanish away.\\nThe roadside flowers, too wet for the bee,\\n Expend their bloom in vain.\\nCome over the hills and far with me,\\n And be my love in the rain.\\n\\nThe birds have less to say for themselves\\n In the wood-world\\'s torn despair\\nThan now these numberless years the elves,\\n Although they are no less there:\\nAll song of the woods is crushed like some\\n Wild, earily shattered rose.\\nCome, be my love in the wet woods, come,\\n Where the boughs rain when it blows.\\n\\nThere is the gale to urge behind\\n And bruit our singing down,\\nAnd the shallow waters aflutter with wind\\n From which to gather your gown.\\nWhat matter if we go clear to the west,\\n And come not through dry-shod?\\nFor wilding brooch shall wet your breast\\n The rain-fresh goldenrod.\\n\\nOh, never this whelming east wind swells\\n But it seems like the sea\\'s return\\nTo the ancient lands where it left the shells\\n Before the age of the fern;\\nAnd it seems like the time when after doubt\\n Our love came back amain.\\nOh, come forth into the storm and rout\\n And be my love in the rain.\\n\\nTo Ridgely Torrence\\nOn Last Looking into His \\'Hesperides\\'\\n\\nI often see flowers from a passing car\\nThat are gone before I can tell what they are.\\n\\nI want to get out of the train and go back\\nTo see what they were beside the track.\\n\\nI name all the flowers I am sure they weren\\'t;\\nNot fireweed loving where woods have burnt-\\n\\nNot bluebells gracing a tunnel mouth-\\nNot lupine living on sand and drouth.\\n\\nWas something brushed across my mind\\nThat no one on earth will ever find?\\n\\nHeaven gives it glimpses only to those\\nNot in position to look too close.\\n\\nThere\\'s a patch of old snow in a corner\\nThat I should have guessed\\nWas a blow-away paper the rain\\nHad brought to rest.\\n\\nIt is speckled with grime as if\\nSmall print overspread it,\\nThe news of a day I\\'ve forgotten —\\nIf I ever read it.\\n\\nDust always blowing about the town,\\nExcept when sea-fog laid it down,\\nAnd I was one of the children told\\nSome of the blowing dust was gold.\\n\\nAll the dust the wind blew high\\nAppeared like god in the sunset sky,\\nBut I was one of the children told\\nSome of the dust was really gold.\\n\\nSuch was life in the Golden Gate:\\nGold dusted all we drank and ate,\\nAnd I was one of the children told,\\n\\'We all must eat our peck of gold.\\'\\n\\nOh, give us pleasure in the flowers today;\\nAnd give us not to think so far away\\nAs the uncertain harvest; keep us here\\nAll simply in the springing of the year.\\n\\nOh, give us pleasure in the orchard white,\\nLike nothing else by day, like ghosts by night;\\nAnd make us happy in the happy bees,\\nThe swarm dilating round the perfect trees.\\n\\nAnd make us happy in the darting bird\\nThat suddenly above the bees is heard,\\nThe meteor that thrusts in with needle bill,\\nAnd off a blossom in mid air stands still.\\n\\nFor this is love and nothing else is love,\\nTo which it is reserved for God above\\nTo sanctify to what far ends he will,\\nBut which it only needs that we fulfill.\\n\\nA voice said, Look me in the stars\\nAnd tell me truly, men of earth,\\nIf all the soul-and-body scars\\nWere not too much to pay for birth.\\n\\nI didn\\'t make you know how glad I was\\nTo have you come and camp here on our land.\\nI promised myself to get down some day\\nAnd see the way you lived, but I don\\'t know!\\nWith a houseful of hungry men to feed\\nI guess you\\'d find…. It seems to me\\nI can\\'t express my feelings any more\\nThan I can raise my voice or want to lift\\nMy hand (oh, I can lift it when I have to).\\nDid ever you feel so? I hope you never.\\nIt\\'s got so I don\\'t even know for sure\\nWhether I am glad, sorry, or anything.\\nThere\\'s nothing but a voice-like left inside\\nThat seems to tell me how I ought to feel,\\nAnd would feel if I wasn\\'t all gone wrong.\\nYou take the lake. I look and look at it.\\nI see it\\'s a fair, pretty sheet of water.\\nI stand and make myself repeat out loud\\nThe advantages it has, so long and narrow,\\nLike a deep piece of some old running river\\nCut short off at both ends. It lies five miles\\nStraight away through the mountain notch\\nFrom the sink window where I wash the plates,\\nAnd all our storms come up toward the house,\\nDrawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and whiter.\\nIt took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit\\nTo step outdoors and take the water dazzle\\nA sunny morning, or take the rising wind\\nAbout my face and body and through my wrapper,\\nWhen a storm threatened from the Dragon\\'s Den,\\nAnd a cold chill shivered across the lake.\\nI see it\\'s a fair, pretty sheet of water,\\nOur Willoughby! How did you hear of it?\\nI expect, though, everyone\\'s heard of it.\\nIn a book about ferns? Listen to that!\\nYou let things more like feathers regulate\\nYour going and coming. And you like it here?\\nI can see how you might. But I don\\'t know!\\nIt would be different if more people came,\\nFor then there would be business. As it is,\\nThe cottages Len built, sometimes we rent them,\\nSometimes we don\\'t. We\\'ve a good piece of shore\\nThat ought to be worth something, and may yet.\\nBut I don\\'t count on it as much as Len.\\nHe looks on the bright side of everything,\\nIncluding me. He thinks I\\'ll be all right\\nWith doctoring. But it\\'s not medicine—\\nLowe is the only doctor\\'s dared to say so—\\nIt\\'s rest I want—there, I have said it out—\\nFrom cooking meals for hungry hired men\\nAnd washing dishes after them—from doing\\nThings over and over that just won\\'t stay done.\\nBy good rights I ought not to have so much\\nPut on me, but there seems no other way.\\nLen says one steady pull more ought to do it.\\nHe says the best way out is always through.\\nAnd I agree to that, or in so far\\nAs that I can see no way out but through—\\nLeastways for me—and then they\\'ll be convinced.\\nIt\\'s not that Len don\\'t want the best for me.\\nIt was his plan our moving over in\\nBeside the lake from where that day I showed you\\nWe used to live—ten miles from anywhere.\\nWe didn\\'t change without some sacrifice,\\nBut Len went at it to make up the loss.\\nHis work\\'s a man\\'s, of course, from sun to sun,\\nBut he works when he works as hard as I do—\\nThough there\\'s small profit in comparisons.\\n(Women and men will make them all the same.)\\nBut work ain\\'t all. Len undertakes too much.\\nHe\\'s into everything in town. This year\\nIt\\'s highways, and he\\'s got too many men\\nAround him to look after that make waste.\\nThey take advantage of him shamefully,\\nAnd proud, too, of themselves for doing so.\\nWe have four here to board, great good-for-nothings,\\nSprawling about the kitchen with their talk\\nWhile I fry their bacon. Much they care!\\nNo more put out in what they do or say\\nThan if I wasn\\'t in the room at all.\\nComing and going all the time, they are:\\nI don\\'t learn what their names are, let alone\\nTheir characters, or whether they are safe\\nTo have inside the house with doors unlocked.\\nI\\'m not afraid of them, though, if they\\'re not\\nAfraid of me. There\\'s two can play at that.\\nI have my fancies: it runs in the family.\\nMy father\\'s brother wasn\\'t right. They kept him\\nLocked up for years back there at the old farm.\\nI\\'ve been away once—yes, I\\'ve been away.\\nThe State Asylum. I was prejudiced;\\nI wouldn\\'t have sent anyone of mine there;\\nYou know the old idea—the only asylum\\nWas the poorhouse, and those who could afford,\\nRather than send their folks to such a place,\\nKept them at home; and it does seem more human.\\nBut it\\'s not so: the place is the asylum.\\nThere they have every means proper to do with,\\nAnd you aren\\'t darkening other people\\'s lives—\\nWorse than no good to them, and they no good\\nTo you in your condition; you can\\'t know\\nAffection or the want of it in that state.\\nI\\'ve heard too much of the old-fashioned way.\\nMy father\\'s brother, he went mad quite young.\\nSome thought he had been bitten by a dog,\\nBecause his violence took on the form\\nOf carrying his pillow in his teeth;\\nBut it\\'s more likely he was crossed in love,\\nOr so the story goes. It was some girl.\\nAnyway all he talked about was love.\\nThey soon saw he would do someone a mischief\\nIf he wa\\'n\\'t kept strict watch of, and it ended\\nIn father\\'s building him a sort of cage,\\nOr room within a room, of hickory poles,\\nLike stanchions in the barn, from floor to ceiling,—\\nA narrow passage all the way around.\\nAnything they put in for furniture\\nHe\\'d tear to pieces, even a bed to lie on.\\nSo they made the place comfortable with straw,\\nLike a beast\\'s stall, to ease their consciences.\\nOf course they had to feed him without dishes.\\nThey tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded\\nWith his clothes on his arm—all of his clothes.\\nCruel—it sounds. I \\'spose they did the best\\nThey knew. And just when he was at the height,\\nFather and mother married, and mother came,\\nA bride, to help take care of such a creature,\\nAnd accommodate her young life to his.\\nThat was what marrying father meant to her.\\nShe had to lie and hear love things made dreadful\\nBy his shouts in the night. He\\'d shout and shout\\nUntil the strength was shouted out of him,\\nAnd his voice died down slowly from exhaustion.\\nHe\\'d pull his bars apart like bow and bow-string,\\nAnd let them go and make them twang until\\nHis hands had worn them smooth as any ox-bow.\\nAnd then he\\'d crow as if he thought that child\\'s play—\\nThe only fun he had. I\\'ve heard them say, though,\\nThey found a way to put a stop to it.\\nHe was before my time—I never saw him;\\nBut the pen stayed exactly as it was\\nThere in the upper chamber in the ell,\\nA sort of catch-all full of attic clutter.\\nI often think of the smooth hickory bars.\\nIt got so I would say—you know, half fooling—\\n\"It\\'s time I took my turn upstairs in jail\"—\\nJust as you will till it becomes a habit.\\nNo wonder I was glad to get away.\\nMind you, I waited till Len said the word.\\nI didn\\'t want the blame if things went wrong.\\nI was glad though, no end, when we moved out,\\nAnd I looked to be happy, and I was,\\nAs I said, for a while—but I don\\'t know!\\nSomehow the change wore out like a prescription.\\nAnd there\\'s more to it than just window-views\\nAnd living by a lake.

He had halted too,\\nAs if for fear of treading upon me.\\nI saw the strange position of his hands—\\nUp at his shoulders, dragging yellow strands\\nOf wire with something in it from men to men.\\n\"You here?\" I said. \"Where aren\\'t you nowadays\\nAnd what\\'s the news you carry—if you know?\\nAnd tell me where you\\'re off for—Montreal?\\nMe?

The latter he nodded “Yes” to,\\nOr paused to say beneath some lovelier one,\\nWith a buyer’s moderation, “That would do.”\\nI thought so too, but wasn’t there to say so.\\nWe climbed the pasture on the south, crossed over,\\nAnd came down on the north.\\nHe said, “A thousand.”\\n\\n“A thousand Christmas trees!—at what apiece?”\\n\\nHe felt some need of softening that to me:\\n“A thousand trees would come to thirty dollars.”\\n\\nThen I was certain I had never meant\\nTo let him have them. Never show surprise!\\nBut thirty dollars seemed so small beside\\nThe extent of pasture I should strip, three cents\\n(For that was all they figured out apiece),\\nThree cents so small beside the dollar friends\\nI should be writing to within the hour\\nWould pay in cities for good trees like those,\\nRegular vestry-trees whole Sunday Schools\\nCould hang enough on to pick off enough.\\nA thousand Christmas trees I didn’t know I had!\\nWorth three cents more to give away than sell,\\nAs may be shown by a simple calculation.\\nToo bad I couldn’t lay one in a letter.\\nI can’t help wishing I could send you one,\\nIn wishing you herewith a Merry Christmas.\\n\\n\\nBlueberries as big as the end of your thumb,\\nReal sky-blue, and heavy, and ready to drum\\nIn the cavernous pail of the first one to come!\\nAnd all ripe together, not some of them green\\nAnd some of them ripe!

Green leaves were here;\\nBut \\'twas the foliage of the rocks--the birch,\\nThe yew, the holly, and the bright green thorn,\\nWith hanging islands of resplendent furze:\\nAnd, on a summit, distant a short space,\\nBy any who should look beyond the dell,\\nA single mountain-cottage might be seen.\\nI gazed and gazed, and to myself I said,\\n\\'Our thoughts at least are ours; and this wild nook,\\nMy EMMA, I will dedicate to thee.\\'\\n----Soon did the spot become my other home,\\nMy dwelling, and my out-of-doors abode.\\nAnd, of the Shepherds who have seen me there,\\nTo whom I sometimes in our idle talk\\nHave told this fancy, two or three, perhaps,\\nYears after we are gone and in our graves,\\nWhen they have cause to speak of this wild place,\\nMay call it by the name of EMMA\\'S DELL.\\n\\nA narrow girdle of rough stones and crags,\\nA rude and natural causeway, interposed\\nBetween the water and a winding slope\\nOf copse and thicket, leaves the eastern shore\\nOf Grasmere safe in its own privacy:\\nAnd there myself and two beloved Friends,\\nOne calm September morning, ere the mist\\nHad altogether yielded to the sun,\\nSauntered on this retired and difficult way.\\n----Ill suits the road with one in haste; but we\\nPlayed with our time; and, as we strolled along,\\nIt was our occupation to observe\\nSuch objects as the waves had tossed ashore--\\nFeather, or leaf, or weed, or withered bough,\\nEach on the other heaped, along the line\\nOf the dry wreck. And, in our vacant mood,\\nNot seldom did we stop to watch some tuft\\nOf dandelion seed or thistle\\'s beard,\\nThat skimmed the surface of the dead calm lake,\\nSuddenly halting now--a lifeless stand!\\nAnd starting off again with freak as sudden;\\nIn all its sportive wanderings, all the while,\\nMaking report of an invisible breeze\\nThat was its wings, its chariot, and its horse,\\nIts playmate, rather say, its moving soul.\\n--And often, trifling with a privilege\\nAlike indulged to all, we paused, one now,\\nAnd now the other, to point out, perchance\\nTo pluck, some flower or water-weed, too fair\\nEither to be divided from the place\\nOn which it grew, or to be left alone\\nTo its own beauty. Many such there are,\\nFair ferns and flowers, and chiefly that tall fern,\\nSo stately, of the queen Osmunda named;\\nPlant lovelier, in its own retired abode\\nOn Grasmere\\'s beach, than Naiad by the side\\nOf Grecian brook, or Lady of the Mere,\\nSole-sitting by the shores of old romance.\\n--So fared we that bright morning: from the fields\\nMeanwhile, a noise was heard, the busy mirth\\nOf reapers, men and women, boys and girls.\\nDelighted much to listen to those sounds,\\nAnd feeding thus our fancies, we advanced\\nAlong the indented shore; when suddenly,\\nThrough a thin veil of glittering haze was seen\\nBefore us, on a point of jutting land,\\nThe tall and upright figure of a Man\\nAttired in peasant\\'s garb, who stood alone,\\nAngling beside the margin of the lake.\\n\\'Improvident and reckless,\\' we exclaimed,\\n\\'The Man must be, who thus can lose a day\\nOf the mid harvest, when the labourer\\'s hire\\nIs ample, and some little might be stored\\nWherewith to cheer him in the winter time.\\'\\nThus talking of that Peasant, we approached\\nClose to the spot where with his rod and line\\nHe stood alone; whereat he turned his head\\nTo greet us--and we saw a Mam worn down\\nBy sickness, gaunt and lean, with sunken cheeks\\nAnd wasted limbs, his legs so long and lean\\nThat for my single self I looked at them,\\nForgetful of the body they sustained.--\\nToo weak to labour in the harvest field,\\nThe Man was using his best skill to gain\\nA pittance from the dead unfeeling lake\\nThat knew not of his wants. I will not say\\nWhat thoughts immediately were ours, nor how\\nThe happy idleness of that sweet morn,\\nWith all its lovely images, was changed\\nTo serious musing and to self-reproach.\\nNor did we fail to see within ourselves\\nWhat need there is to be reserved in speech,\\nAnd temper all our thoughts with charity.\\n--Therefore, unwilling to forget that day,\\nMy Friend, Myself, and She who then received\\nThe same admonishment, have called the place\\nBy a memorial name, uncouth indeed\\nAs e\\'er by mariner was given to bay\\nOr foreland, on a new-discovered coast;\\nAnd POINT RASH-JUDGMENT is the name it bears.\\n\\nFive years have past; five summers, with the length\\nOf five long winters! and again I hear\\nThese waters, rolling from their mountain-springs\\nWith a soft inland murmur.--Once again\\nDo I behold these steep and lofty cliffs,\\nThat on a wild secluded scene impress\\nThoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect\\nThe landscape with the quiet of the sky.\\nThe day is come when I again repose\\nHere, under this dark sycamore, and view\\nThese plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts,\\nWhich at this season, with their unripe fruits,\\nAre clad in one green hue, and lose themselves\\n\\'Mid groves and copses. Once again I see\\nThese hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines\\nOf sportive wood run wild: these pastoral farms,\\nGreen to the very door; and wreaths of smoke\\nSent up, in silence, from among the trees!\\nWith some uncertain notice, as might seem\\nOf vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,\\nOr of some Hermit\\'s cave, where by his fire\\nThe Hermit sits alone.\\nThese beauteous forms,\\nThrough a long absence, have not been to me\\nAs is a landscape to a blind man\\'s eye:\\nBut oft, in lonely rooms, and \\'mid the din\\nOf towns and cities, I have owed to them\\nIn hours of weariness, sensations sweet,\\nFelt in the blood, and felt along the heart;\\nAnd passing even into my purer mind,\\nWith tranquil restoration:--feelings too\\nOf unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps,\\nAs have no slight or trivial influence\\nOn that best portion of a good man\\'s life,\\nHis little, nameless, unremembered, acts\\nOf kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust,\\nTo them I may have owed another gift,\\nOf aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,\\nIn which the burthen of the mystery,\\nIn which the heavy and the weary weight\\nOf all this unintelligible world,\\nIs lightened:--that serene and blessed mood,\\nIn which the affections gently lead us on,--\\nUntil, the breath of this corporeal frame\\nAnd even the motion of our human blood\\nAlmost suspended, we are laid asleep\\nIn body, and become a living soul:\\nWhile with an eye made quiet by the power\\nOf harmony, and the deep power of joy,\\nWe see into the life of things.\\nIf this\\nBe but a vain belief, yet, oh! how oft--\\nIn darkness and amid the many shapes\\nOf joyless daylight; when the fretful stir\\nUnprofitable, and the fever of the world,\\nHave hung upon the beatings of my heart--\\nHow oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee,\\nO sylvan Wye! thou wanderer thro\\' the woods,\\nHow often has my spirit turned to thee!\\nAnd now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought,\\nWith many recognitions dim and faint,\\nAnd somewhat of a sad perplexity,\\nThe picture of the mind revives again:\\nWhile here I stand, not only with the sense\\nOf present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts\\nThat in this moment there is life and food\\nFor future years. And so I dare to hope,\\nThough changed, no doubt, from what I was when first\\nI came among these hills; when like a roe\\nI bounded o\\'er the mountains, by the sides\\nOf the deep rivers, and the lonely streams,\\nWherever nature led: more like a man\\nFlying from something that he dreads, than one\\nWho sought the thing he loved. For nature then\\n(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days,\\nAnd their glad animal movements all gone by)\\nTo me was all in all.--I cannot paint\\nWhat then I was. The sounding cataract\\nHaunted me like a passion: the tall rock,\\nThe mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,\\nTheir colours and their forms, were then to me\\nAn appetite; a feeling and a love,\\nThat had no need of a remoter charm,\\nBy thought supplied, nor any interest\\nUnborrowed from the eye.--That time is past,\\nAnd all its aching joys are now no more,\\nAnd all its dizzy raptures. Not for this\\nFaint I, nor mourn nor murmur, other gifts\\nHave followed; for such loss, I would believe,\\nAbundant recompence. For I have learned\\nTo look on nature, not as in the hour\\nOf thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes\\nThe still, sad music of humanity,\\nNor harsh nor grating, though of ample power\\nTo chasten and subdue. And I have felt\\nA presence that disturbs me with the joy\\nOf elevated thoughts; a sense sublime\\nOf something far more deeply interfused,\\nWhose dwelling is the light of setting suns,\\nAnd the round ocean and the living air,\\nAnd the blue sky, and in the mind of man;\\nA motion and a spirit, that impels 0\\nAll thinking things, all objects of all thought,\\nAnd rolls through all things. Therefore am I still\\nA lover of the meadows and the woods,\\nAnd mountains; and of all that we behold\\nFrom this green earth; of all the mighty world\\nOf eye, and ear,--both what they half create,\\nAnd what perceive; well pleased to recognise\\nIn nature and the language of the sense,\\nThe anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,\\nThe guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul\\nOf all my moral being.\\nNor perchance,\\nIf I were not thus taught, should I the more\\nSuffer my genial spirits to decay:\\nFor thou art with me here upon the banks\\nOf this fair river; thou my dearest Friend,\\nMy dear, dear Friend; and in thy voice I catch\\nThe language of my former heart, and read\\nMy former pleasures in the shooting lights\\nOf thy wild eyes. Oh! yet a little while\\nMay I behold in thee what I was once,\\nMy dear, dear Sister! and this prayer I make,\\nKnowing that Nature never did betray\\nThe heart that loved her; \\'tis her privilege,\\nThrough all the years of this our life, to lead\\nFrom joy to joy: for she can so inform\\nThe mind that is within us, so impress\\nWith quietness and beauty, and so feed\\nWith lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,\\nRash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,\\nNor greetings where no kindness is, nor all\\nThe dreary intercourse of daily life,\\nShall e\\'er prevail against us, or disturb\\nOur cheerful faith, that all which we behold\\nIs full of blessings. Therefore let the moon\\nShine on thee in thy solitary walk;\\nAnd let the misty mountain-winds be free\\nTo blow against thee: and, in after years,\\nWhen these wild ecstasies shall be matured\\nInto a sober pleasure; when thy mind\\nShall be a mansion for all lovely forms,\\nThy memory be as a dwelling-place\\nFor all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then,\\nIf solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,\\nShould be thy portion, with what healing thoughts\\nOf tender joy wilt thou remember me,\\nAnd these my exhortations! Nor, perchance--\\nIf I should be where I no more can hear\\nThy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams\\nOf past existence--wilt thou then forget\\nThat on the banks of this delightful stream\\nWe stood together; and that I, so long\\nA worshipper of Nature, hither came\\nUnwearied in that service: rather say\\nWith warmer love--oh! with far deeper zeal\\nOf holier love. Nor wilt thou then forget,\\nThat after many wanderings, many years\\nOf absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs,\\nAnd this green pastoral landscape, were to me\\nMore dear, both for themselves and for thy sake!\\n\\nA Whirl-Blast from behind the hill\\nRushed o\\'er the wood with startling sound;\\nThen--all at once the air was still,\\nAnd showers of hailstones pattered round.\\nWhere leafless oaks towered high above,\\nI sat within an undergrove\\nOf tallest hollies, tall and green;\\nA fairer bower was never seen.\\nFrom year to year the spacious floor\\nWith withered leaves is covered o\\'er,\\nAnd all the year the bower is green.\\nBut see! where\\'er the hailstones drop\\nThe withered leaves all skip and hop;\\nThere\\'s not a breeze--no breath of air--\\nYet here, and there, and everywhere\\nAlong the floor, beneath the shade\\nBy those embowering hollies made,\\nThe leaves in myriads jump and spring,\\nAs if with pipes and music rare\\nSome Robin Good-fellow were there,\\nAnd all those leaves, in festive glee,\\nWere dancing to the minstrelsy.\\n\\nStrange fits of passion have I known:\\nAnd I will dare to tell,\\nBut in the lover\\'s ear alone,\\nWhat once to me befell.\\n\\nWhen she I loved looked every day\\nFresh as a rose in June,\\nI to her cottage bent my way,\\nBeneath an evening-moon.\\n\\nUpon the moon I fixed my eye,\\nAll over the wide lea;\\nWith quickening pace my horse drew nigh\\nThose paths so dear to me.\\n\\nAnd now we reached the orchard-plot;\\nAnd, as we climbed the hill,\\nThe sinking moon to Lucy\\'s cot\\nCame near, and nearer still.\\n\\nIn one of those sweet dreams I slept,\\nKind Nature\\'s gentlest boon!\\nAnd all the while my eye I kept\\nOn the descending moon.\\n\\nMy horse moved on; hoof after hoof\\nHe raised, and never stopped:\\nWhen down behind the cottage roof,\\nAt once, the bright moon dropped.\\n\\nWhat fond and wayward thoughts will slide\\nInto a Lover\\'s head!\\n\\'O mercy!\\' to myself I cried,\\n\\'If Lucy hould be dead!\\'\\n\\nA slumber did my spirit seal\\nI had no human fears:\\nShe seemed a thing that could not feel\\nThe touch of earthly years.\\n\\nNo motion has she now, no force;\\nShe neither hears nor sees;\\nRolled round in earth\\'s diurnal course,\\nWith rocks, and stones, and trees.\\n\\nEarth has not anything to show more fair:\\nDull would he be of soul who could pass by\\nA sight so touching in its majesty:\\nThis City now doth, like a garment, wear\\nThe beauty of the morning; silent, bare,\\nShips, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie\\nOpen unto the fields, and to the sky;\\nAll bright and glittering in the smokeless air.\\nNever did sun more beautifully steep\\nIn his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;\\nNe\\'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!\\nThe river glideth at his own sweet will:\\nDear God!

caught wind and, opening out its covers,\\ntried to improve on sailing like a tile\\nby flying like a bird (silent in flight,\\nbut all the burden of its body song),\\nonly to tumble like a stricken

that.\\ni have my fancies: it runs in the family.\\nmy father\\'s brother wasn\\'t right. they kept him\\nlocked up for years back there at the old farm.\\ni\\'ve been away once—yes, i\\'ve been away.\\nthe state asylum. i was prejudiced;\\ni wouldn\\'t have sent anyone of mine there;\\nyou know the old idea—the only asylum\\nwas the poorhouse, and those who could afford,\\nrather than send their folks to such a place,\\nkept them at home; and it does seem more human.\\nbut it\\'s not so: the place is the asylum.\\nthere they have every means proper to do with,\\nand you aren\\'t darkening other people\\'s lives—\\nworse than no good to them, and they no good\\nto you in your condition; you can\\'t know\\naffection or the want of it in that state.\\ni\\'ve heard too much of the old-fashioned way.\\nmy father\\'s brother, he went mad quite young.\\nsome thought he had been bitten by a dog,\\nbecause his violence took on the form\\nof carrying his pillow in his teeth;\\nbut it\\'s more likely he was crossed in love,\\nor so the story goes. it was some girl.\\nanyway all he talked about was love.\\nthey soon saw he would do someone a mischief\\nif he wa\\'n\\'t kept strict watch of, and it ended\\nin father\\'s building him a sort of cage,\\nor room within a room, of hickory poles,\\nlike stanchions in the barn, from floor to ceiling,—\\na narrow passage all the way around.\\nanything they put in for furniture\\nhe\\'d tear to pieces, even a bed to lie on.\\nso they made the place comfortable with straw,\\nlike a beast\\'s stall, to ease their consciences.\\nof course they had to feed him without dishes.\\nthey tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded\\nwith his clothes on his arm—all of his clothes.\\ncruel—it sounds. i \\'spose they did the best\\nthey knew. and just when he was at the height,\\nfather and mother married, and mother came,\\na bride, to help take care of such a creature,\\nand accommodate her young life to his.\\nthat was what marrying father meant to her.\\nshe had to lie and hear love things made dreadful\\nby his shouts in the night. he\\'d shout and shout\\nuntil the strength was shouted out of him,\\nand his voice died down slowly from exhaustion.\\nhe\\'d pull his bars apart like bow and bow-string,\\nand let them go and make them twang until\\nhis hands had worn them smooth as any ox-bow.\\nand then he\\'d crow as if he thought that child\\'s play—\\nthe only fun he had. i\\'ve heard them say, though,\\nthey found a way to put a stop to it.\\nhe was before my time—i never saw him;\\nbut the pen stayed exactly as it was\\nthere in the upper chamber in the ell,\\na sort of catch-all full of attic clutter.\\ni often think of the smooth hickory bars.\\nit got so i would say—you know, half fooling—\\n\"it\\'s time i took my turn upstairs in jail\"—\\njust as you will till it becomes a habit.\\nno wonder i was glad to get away.\\nmind you, i waited till len said the word.\\ni didn\\'t want the blame if things went wrong.\\ni was glad though, no end, when we moved out,\\nand i looked to be happy, and i was,\\nas i said, for a while—but i don\\'t know!\\nsomehow the change wore out like a prescription.\\nand there\\'s more to it than just window-views\\nand living by a lake. i\\'m past such help—\\nunless len took the notion, which he won\\'t,\\nand i won\\'t ask him—it\\'s not sure enough.\\ni \\'spose i\\'ve got to go the road i\\'m going:\\nother folks have to, and why shouldn\\'t i?\\ni almost think if i could do like you,\\ndrop everything and live out on the ground—\\nbut it might be, come night, i shouldn\\'t like it,\\nor a long rain. i should soon get enough,\\nand be glad of a good roof overhead.\\ni\\'ve lain awake thinking of you, i\\'ll warrant,\\nmore than you have yourself, some of these nights.\\nthe wonder was the tents weren\\'t snatched away\\nfrom over you as you lay in your beds.\\ni haven\\'t courage for a risk like that.\\nbless you, of course, you\\'re keeping me from work,\\nbut the thing of it is, i need to be kept.\\nthere\\'s work enough to do—there\\'s always that;\\nbut behind\\'s behind. the worst that

stone-cold,\\nand saving that its weight suggested gold\\nand tugged it from his first too certain hold,\\n\\nhe noticed nothing in it to remark.\\nhe was not used to handling stars thrown dark\\nand lifeless from an interrupted arc.\\n\\nhe did not recognize in that smooth coal\\nthe one thing palpable besides the soul\\nto penetrate the air in which we roll.\\n\\nhe did not see how like a flying thing\\nit brooded ant eggs, and bad one large wing,\\none not so large for flying in a ring,\\n\\nand a long bird of paradise\\'s tail\\n(though these when not in use to fly and trail\\nit drew back in its body like a snail):\\n\\nnor know that be might move it from the spot—\\nthe harm was done: from having been star-shot\\nthe very nature of the soil was hot\\n\\nand burning to yield flowers instead of grain,\\nflowers fanned and not put out by all the rain\\npoured on them by his prayers prayed in vain.\\n\\nhe moved it roughly with an iron bar,\\nhe loaded an old stoneboat with the star\\nand not, as you might think, a flying car,\\n\\nsuch as even poets would admit perforce\\nmore practical than pegasus the horse\\nif it could put a star back in its course.\\n\\nhe dragged it through the plowed ground at a pace\\nbut faintly reminiscent of the race\\nof jostling rock in interstellar space.\\n\\nit went for building stone, and i, as though\\ncommanded in a dream, forever go\\nto right the wrong that this should have been so.\\n\\nyet ask where else it could have gone as well,\\ni do not know—i cannot stop to tell:\\nhe might have left it lying where it fell.\\n\\nfrom

out\\na-buttoning coats to ask him who he was.\\nhe proved to be the city come again\\nto look for something it had left behind\\nand could not do without and keep its christmas.\\nhe asked if i would sell my christmas trees;\\nmy woods—the young fir balsams like a place\\nwhere houses all are churches and have spires.\\ni hadn’t thought of them as christmas trees.\\ni doubt if i was tempted for a moment\\nto sell them off their feet to go in cars\\nand leave the slope behind the house all bare,\\nwhere the sun shines now no warmer than the moon.\\ni’d hate to have them know it if i was.\\nyet more i’d hate to hold my trees except\\nas others hold theirs or refuse for them,\\nbeyond the time of profitable growth,\\nthe trial by market everything must come to.\\ni dallied so much with the thought of selling.\\nthen whether from mistaken courtesy\\nand fear of seeming short of speech, or whether\\nfrom hope of hearing good of what was mine,\\ni said, “there aren’t enough to be worth while.”\\n“i could soon tell how many they would cut,\\nyou let me look them over.”\\n\\n“you could look.\\nbut don’t expect i’m going to let you have them.”\\npasture they spring in, some in clumps too close\\nthat lop each other of boughs, but not a few\\nquite solitary and having equal boughs\\nall round and round. the latter he nodded “yes” to,\\nor paused to say beneath some lovelier one,\\nwith a buyer’s moderation, “that would do.”\\ni thought so too, but wasn’t there to say so.\\nwe climbed the pasture on the south, crossed over,\\nand came down on the north.\\nhe said, “a thousand.”\\n\\n“a thousand christmas trees!—at what apiece?”\\n\\nhe felt some need of softening that to me:\\n“a thousand trees would come to thirty dollars.”\\n\\nthen i was certain i had never meant\\nto let him have them. never show surprise!\\nbut thirty dollars seemed so small beside\\nthe extent of pasture i should strip, three cents\\n(for that was all they figured out apiece),\\nthree

unobserving eye\\nbent earthwards; he looks up--the clouds are split\\nasunder,--and above his head he sees\\nthe clear moon, and the glory of the heavens.\\nthere, in a black-blue vault she sails along,\\nfollowed by multitudes of stars, that, small\\nand sharp, and bright, along the dark abyss\\ndrive as she drives: how fast they wheel away,\\nyet vanish not!--the wind is in the tree,\\nbut they are silent;--still they roll along\\nimmeasurably distant; and the vault,\\nbuilt round by those white clouds, enormous clouds,\\nstill deepens its unfathomable depth.\\nat length the vision closes; and the mind,\\nnot undisturbed by the delight it feels,\\nwhich slowly settles into peaceful calm,\\nis left to muse upon the solemn scene.\\n\\nit was an april morning: fresh and clear\\nthe rivulet, delighting in its strength,\\nran with a young man\\'s speed; and yet the voice\\nof waters which the winter had supplied\\nwas softened down into a vernal tone.\\nthe spirit of enjoyment and desire,\\nand hopes and wishes, from all living things\\nwent circling, like a multitude of sounds.\\nthe budding groves seemed eager to urge on\\nthe steps of june; as if their various hues\\nwere only hindrances that stood between\\nthem and their object: but, meanwhile, prevailed\\nsuch an entire contentment in the air\\nthat every naked ash, and tardy tree\\nyet leafless, showed as if the countenance\\nwith which it looked on this delightful day\\nwere native to the summer.--up the brook\\ni roamed in the confusion of my heart,\\nalive to all things and forgetting all.\\nat length i to a sudden turning came\\nin this continuous glen, where down a rock\\nthe stream, so ardent in its course before,\\nsent forth such sallies of glad sound, that all\\nwhich i till then had heard, appeared the voice\\nof common pleasure: beast and bird, the lamb,\\nthe shepherd\\'s dog, the linnet and the thrush\\nvied with this waterfall, and made a song,\\nwhich, while i listened, seemed like the wild growth\\nor like some natural produce of the air,\\nthat could not cease to be. green leaves were here;\\nbut \\'twas the foliage of the rocks--the birch,\\nthe yew, the holly, and the bright green thorn,\\nwith hanging islands of resplendent furze:\\nand, on a summit, distant a short space,\\nby any who should look beyond the dell,\\na single mountain-cottage might be seen.\\ni gazed and gazed, and to myself i said,\\n\\'our thoughts at least are ours; and this wild nook,\\nmy emma, i will dedicate to thee.\\'\\n----soon did the spot become my other home,\\nmy dwelling, and my out-of-doors abode.\\nand, of the shepherds who have seen me there,\\nto whom i sometimes in our idle talk\\nhave told this fancy, two or three, perhaps,\\nyears after we are gone and in our graves,\\nwhen they have cause to speak of this wild place,\\nmay call it by the name of emma\\'s dell.\\n\\na narrow girdle of rough stones and crags,\\na rude and natural causeway, interposed\\nbetween the water and a winding slope\\nof copse and thicket, leaves the eastern shore\\nof grasmere safe in its own privacy:\\nand there myself and two beloved friends,\\none calm september morning, ere the mist\\nhad altogether yielded to the sun,\\nsauntered on this retired and difficult way.\\n----ill suits the road with one in haste; but we\\nplayed with our time; and, as we strolled along,\\nit was our occupation to observe\\nsuch objects as the waves had tossed ashore--\\nfeather, or leaf, or weed, or withered bough,\\neach on the other heaped, along the line\\nof the dry wreck. and, in our vacant mood,\\nnot seldom did we stop to watch some tuft\\nof dandelion seed or thistle\\'s beard,\\nthat skimmed the surface of the dead calm lake,\\nsuddenly halting now--a lifeless stand!\\nand starting off again with freak as sudden;\\nin all its sportive wanderings, all the while,\\nmaking report of an invisible breeze\\nthat was its wings, its chariot, and its horse,\\nits playmate, rather say, its moving soul.\\n--and often, trifling with a privilege\\nalike indulged to all, we paused, one now,\\nand now the other, to point out, perchance\\nto pluck, some flower or water-weed, too fair\\neither to be divided from the place\\non which it grew, or to be left alone\\nto its own beauty. many such there are,\\nfair ferns and flowers, and chiefly that tall fern,\\nso stately, of the queen osmunda named;\\nplant lovelier, in its own retired abode\\non grasmere\\'s beach, than naiad by the side\\nof grecian brook, or lady of the mere,\\nsole-sitting by the shores of old romance.\\n--so fared we that bright morning: from the fields\\nmeanwhile, a noise was heard, the busy mirth\\nof reapers, men and women, boys and girls.\\ndelighted much to listen to those sounds,\\nand feeding thus our fancies, we advanced\\nalong the indented shore; when suddenly,\\nthrough a thin veil of glittering haze was seen\\nbefore us, on a point of jutting land,\\nthe tall and upright figure of a man\\nattired in peasant\\'s garb, who stood alone,\\nangling beside the margin of the lake.\\n\\'improvident and reckless,\\' we exclaimed,\\n\\'the man must be, who thus can lose a day\\nof the mid harvest, when the labourer\\'s hire\\nis ample, and some little might be stored\\nwherewith to cheer him in the winter time.\\'\\nthus talking of that peasant, we approached\\nclose to the spot where with his rod and line\\nhe stood alone; whereat he turned his head\\nto greet us--and we saw a mam worn down\\nby sickness, gaunt and lean, with sunken cheeks\\nand wasted limbs, his legs so long and lean\\nthat for my single self i looked at them,\\nforgetful of the body they sustained.--\\ntoo weak to labour in the harvest field,\\nthe man was using his best skill to gain\\na pittance from the dead unfeeling lake\\nthat knew not of his wants. i will not say\\nwhat thoughts immediately were ours, nor how\\nthe happy idleness of that sweet morn,\\nwith all its lovely images, was changed\\nto serious musing and to self-reproach.\\nnor did we fail to see within ourselves\\nwhat need there is to be reserved in speech,\\nand temper all our thoughts with charity.\\n--therefore, unwilling to forget that day,\\nmy friend, myself, and she who then received\\nthe same admonishment, have called the place\\nby a memorial name, uncouth indeed\\nas e\\'er by mariner was given to bay\\nor foreland, on a new-discovered coast;\\nand point rash-judgment is the name it bears.\\n\\nfive years have past; five summers, with the length\\nof five long winters! and again i hear\\nthese waters, rolling from their mountain-springs\\nwith a soft inland murmur.--once again\\ndo i behold these steep and lofty cliffs,\\nthat on a wild secluded scene impress\\nthoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect\\nthe landscape with the quiet of the sky.\\nthe day is come when i again repose\\nhere, under this dark sycamore, and view\\nthese plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts,\\nwhich at this season, with their unripe fruits,\\nare clad in one green hue, and lose themselves\\n\\'mid groves and copses. once again i see\\nthese hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines\\nof sportive wood run wild: these pastoral farms,\\ngreen to the very door; and wreaths of smoke\\nsent up, in silence, from among the trees!\\nwith some uncertain notice, as might seem\\nof vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,\\nor of some hermit\\'s cave, where by his fire\\nthe hermit sits alone.\\nthese beauteous forms,\\nthrough a long absence, have not been to me\\nas is a landscape to a blind man\\'s eye:\\nbut oft, in lonely rooms, and \\'mid the din\\nof towns and cities, i have owed to them\\nin hours of weariness, sensations sweet,\\nfelt in the blood, and felt along the heart;\\nand passing even into my purer mind,\\nwith tranquil restoration:--feelings too\\nof unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps,\\nas have no slight or trivial influence\\non that best portion of a good man\\'s life,\\nhis little, nameless, unremembered, acts\\nof kindness and of love. nor less, i trust,\\nto them i may have owed another gift,\\nof aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,\\nin which the burthen of the mystery,\\nin which the heavy and the weary weight\\nof all this unintelligible world,\\nis lightened:--that serene and blessed mood,\\nin which the affections gently lead us on,--\\nuntil, the breath of this corporeal frame\\nand even the motion of our human blood\\nalmost suspended, we are laid asleep\\nin body, and become a living soul:\\nwhile with an eye made quiet by the power\\nof harmony, and the deep power of joy,\\nwe see into the life of things.\\nif this\\nbe but a vain belief, yet, oh! how oft--\\nin darkness and amid the many shapes\\nof joyless daylight; when the fretful stir\\nunprofitable, and the fever of the world,\\nhave hung upon the beatings of my heart--\\nhow oft, in spirit, have i turned to thee,\\no sylvan wye! thou wanderer thro\\' the woods,\\nhow often has my spirit turned to thee!\\nand now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought,\\nwith many recognitions dim and faint,\\nand somewhat of a sad perplexity,\\nthe picture of the mind revives again:\\nwhile here i stand, not only with the sense\\nof present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts\\nthat in this moment there is life and food\\nfor future years. and so i dare to hope,\\nthough changed, no doubt, from what i was when first\\ni came among these hills; when like a roe\\ni bounded o\\'er the mountains, by the sides\\nof the deep rivers, and the lonely streams,\\nwherever nature led: more like a man\\nflying from something that he dreads, than one\\nwho sought the thing he loved. for nature then\\n(the coarser pleasures of my boyish days,\\nand their glad animal movements all gone by)\\nto me was all in all.--i cannot paint\\nwhat then i was. the sounding cataract\\nhaunted me like a passion: the tall rock,\\nthe mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,\\ntheir colours and their forms, were then to me\\nan appetite; a feeling and a love,\\nthat had no need of a remoter charm,\\nby thought supplied, nor any interest\\nunborrowed from the eye.--that time is past,\\nand all its aching joys are now no more,\\nand all its dizzy raptures. not for this\\nfaint i, nor mourn nor murmur, other gifts\\nhave followed; for such loss, i would believe,\\nabundant recompence. for i have learned\\nto look on nature, not as in the hour\\nof thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes\\nthe still, sad music of humanity,\\nnor harsh nor grating, though of ample power\\nto chasten and subdue. and i have felt\\na presence that disturbs me with the joy\\nof elevated thoughts; a sense sublime\\nof something far more deeply interfused,\\nwhose dwelling is the light of setting suns,\\nand the round ocean and the living air,\\nand the blue sky, and in the mind of man;\\na motion and a spirit, that impels 0\\nall thinking things, all objects of all thought,\\nand rolls through all things. therefore am i still\\na lover of the meadows and the woods,\\nand mountains; and of all that we behold\\nfrom this green earth; of all the mighty world\\nof eye, and ear,--both what they half create,\\nand what perceive; well pleased to recognise\\nin nature and the language of the sense,\\nthe anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,\\nthe guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul\\nof all my moral being.\\nnor perchance,\\nif i were not thus taught, should i the more\\nsuffer my genial spirits to decay:\\nfor thou art with me here upon the banks\\nof this fair river; thou my dearest friend,\\nmy dear, dear friend; and in thy voice i catch\\nthe language of my former heart, and read\\nmy former pleasures in the shooting lights\\nof thy wild eyes. oh! yet a little while\\nmay i behold in thee what i was once,\\nmy dear, dear sister! and this prayer i make,\\nknowing that nature never did betray\\nthe heart that loved her; \\'tis her privilege,\\nthrough all the years of this our life, to lead\\nfrom joy to joy: for she can so inform\\nthe mind that is within us, so impress\\nwith quietness and beauty, and so feed\\nwith lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,\\nrash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,\\nnor greetings where no kindness is, nor all\\nthe dreary intercourse of daily life,\\nshall e\\'er prevail against us, or disturb\\nour cheerful faith, that all which we behold\\nis full of blessings. therefore let the moon\\nshine on thee in thy solitary walk;\\nand let the misty mountain-winds be free\\nto blow against thee: and, in after years,\\nwhen these wild ecstasies shall be matured\\ninto a sober pleasure; when thy mind\\nshall be a mansion for all lovely forms,\\nthy memory be as a dwelling-place\\nfor all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then,\\nif solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,\\nshould be thy portion, with what healing thoughts\\nof tender joy wilt thou remember me,\\nand these my exhortations! nor, perchance--\\nif i should be where i no more can hear\\nthy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams\\nof past existence--wilt thou then forget\\nthat on the banks of this delightful stream\\nwe stood together; and that i, so long\\na worshipper of nature, hither came\\nunwearied in that service: rather say\\nwith warmer love--oh! with far deeper zeal\\nof holier love. nor wilt thou then forget,\\nthat after many wanderings, many years\\nof absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs,\\nand this green pastoral landscape, were to me\\nmore dear, both for themselves and for thy sake!\\n\\na whirl-blast from behind the hill\\nrushed o\\'er the wood with startling sound;\\nthen--all at once the air was still,\\nand showers of hailstones pattered round.\\nwhere leafless oaks towered high above,\\ni sat within an undergrove\\nof tallest hollies, tall and green;\\na fairer bower was never seen.\\nfrom year to year the spacious floor\\nwith withered leaves is covered o\\'er,\\nand all the year the bower is green.\\nbut see! where\\'er the hailstones drop\\nthe withered leaves all skip and hop;\\nthere\\'s not a breeze--no breath of air--\\nyet here, and there, and everywhere\\nalong the floor, beneath the shade\\nby those embowering hollies made,\\nthe leaves in myriads jump and spring,\\nas if with pipes and music rare\\nsome robin good-fellow were there,\\nand all those leaves, in festive glee,\\nwere dancing to the minstrelsy.\\n\\nstrange fits of passion have i known:\\nand i will dare to tell,\\nbut in the lover\\'s ear alone,\\nwhat once to me befell.\\n\\nwhen she i loved looked every day\\nfresh as a rose in june,\\ni to her cottage bent my way,\\nbeneath an evening-moon.\\n\\nupon the moon i fixed my eye,\\nall over the wide lea;\\nwith quickening pace my horse drew nigh\\nthose paths so dear to me.\\n\\nand now we reached the orchard-plot;\\nand, as we climbed the hill,\\nthe sinking moon to lucy\\'s cot\\ncame near, and nearer still.\\n\\nin one of those sweet dreams i slept,\\nkind nature\\'s gentlest boon!\\nand all the while my eye i kept\\non the descending moon.\\n\\nmy horse moved on; hoof after hoof\\nhe raised, and never stopped:\\nwhen down behind the cottage roof,\\nat once, the bright moon dropped.\\n\\nwhat fond and wayward thoughts will slide\\ninto a lover\\'s head!\\n\\'o mercy!\\' to myself i cried,\\n\\'if lucy hould be dead!\\'\\n\\na slumber did my spirit

partly have been in me\\nthe bird was not to blame for his key\\n\\nand of course there must be something wrong\\nin wanting to silence any song\\n\\nhe halted in the wind and — what was that\\nfar in the maples pale but not a ghost?\\nhe stood there bringing march against his thought\\nand yet too ready to believe the most\\n\\noh thats the paradiseinbloom i said\\nand truly it was fair enough for flowers\\nhad we but in us to assume in march\\nsuch white luxuriance of may for ours\\n\\nwe stood a moment so in a strange world\\nmyself as one his own pretense deceives\\nand then i said the truth and we moved on\\na young beech clinging to its last years leaves\\n\\nthe farmhouse lingers though averse to square\\nwith the new city street it has to wear\\na number in but what about the brook\\nthat held the house as in an elbowcrook?\\ni ask as one who knew the brook its strength\\nand impulse having dipped a finger length\\nand made it leap my knuckle having tossed\\na flower to try its currents where they crossed\\nthe meadow grass could be cemented down\\nfrom growing under pavements of a town\\nthe apple trees be sent to hearthstone flame\\nis water wood to serve a brook the same?\\nhow else dispose of an immortal force\\nno longer needed? staunch it at its source\\nwith cinder loads dumped down? the brook was thrown\\ndeep in a sewer dungeon under stone\\nin fetid darkness still to live and run —\\nand all for nothing it had ever done\\nexcept forget to go in fear perhaps\\nno one would know except for ancient maps\\nthat such a brook ran water but i wonder\\nif from its being kept forever under\\nthe thoughts may not have risen that so keep\\nthis newbuilt city from both work and sleep\\n\\nmist i dont believe the sleepers in the house know where they are\\nsmoke theyve been here long enough to push the woods back from around the house and part them in the middle with a path\\nmist and still i doubt if they know where they are and i begin to fear they never will all they maintain the path for is the comfort of visiting with the equally bewildered nearer in plight their neighbors are than distance\\nsmoke i am the guardian wraith of starlit smoke that leans out this and that way from their chimney i will not have their happiness despaired of\\nmist no one  not i would give them up for lost simply because they dont know where they are  i am the damper counterpart of smoke that gives off from a garden ground at night but lifts no higher than a garden grows i cotton to their landscape thats who i am i am no further from their fate than you are\\nsmoke they must by now have learned the native tongue why dont they ask the red man where they are?\\nmist  they often do and none the wiser for it so do they also ask philosophers who come to look in on them from the pulpit they will ask anyone there is to ask  in the fond faith accumulated fact  will of itself take fire\\nand light the world up learning has been a part of their\\nreligion\\nsmoke  if the day ever comes when they know who they are they may know better where they are but who they are is too much to believe  either for them or the onlooking world they are too sudden to be credible\\nmist  listen they murmur talking in the dark on what\\nshould be their daylong theme continued putting the lamp out has not put their thought out let us pretend the dewdrops from the leaves are you and i evesdropping on their unrest  a mist and smoke evesdropping on a haze  and see if we can tell the bass from the soprano\\nthan smoke and mist who better could appraise  the kindered spirit of an inner haze!\\nsmoke  if the day ever comes\\n\\nthere sandy seems the golden sky\\nand golden seems the sandy plain\\nno habitation meets the eye\\nunless in the horizon rim\\nsome halfway up the limestone wall\\nthat spot of black is not a stain\\nor shadow but a cavern hole\\nwhere someone used to climb and crawl\\nto rest from his besetting fears\\ni see the callus on his soul\\nthe disappearing last of him\\nand of his race starvation slim\\noh years ago  ten thousand years\\n\\ni had withdrawn in forest and my song\\nwas swallowed up in leaves that blew alway\\nand to the forest edge you came one day\\nthis was my dream and looked and pondered long\\nbut did not enter though the wish was strong\\nyou shook your pensive head as who should say\\n‘i dare not—too far in his footsteps stray—\\nhe must seek me would he undo the wrong\\n\\nnot far but near i stood and saw it all\\nbehind low boughs the trees let down outside\\nand the sweet pang it cost me not to call\\nand tell you that i saw does still abide\\nbut tis not true that thus i dwelt aloof\\nfor the wood wakes and you are here for proof\\n\\nold davis owned a solid mica mountain\\nin dalton that would someday make his fortune\\nthered been some boston people out to see it\\nand experts said that deep down in the mountain\\nthe mica sheets were big as plateglass windows\\nhed like to take me there and show it to me\\n\\nill tell you what you show me you remember\\nyou said you knew the place where once on kinsman\\nthe early mormons made a settlement\\nand built a stone baptismal font outdoors\\nbut smith or someone called them off the mountain\\nto go west to a worse fight with the desert\\nyou said youd seen the stone baptismal font\\nwell take me there\\n\\nsomeday i will\\n\\ntoday\\n\\nhuh that old bathtub what is that to see?\\nlets talk about it\\n\\nlets go see the place\\n\\nto shut you up ill tell you what ill do\\nill find that fountain if it takes all summer\\nand both of our united strengths to do it\\n\\nyouve lost it then?\\n\\nnot so but i can find it\\nno doubt its grown up some to woods around it\\nthe mountain may have shifted since i saw it\\nin eightyfive\\n\\nas long ago as that?\\n\\nif i remember rightly it had sprung\\na leak and emptied then and forty years\\ncan do a good deal to bad masonry\\nyou wont see any mormon swimming in it\\nbut you have said it and were off to find it\\nold as i am im going to let myself\\nbe dragged by you all over everywhere \\ni thought you were a guide\\n\\ni am a guide\\nand thats why i cant decently refuse you\\n\\nwe made a day of it out of the world\\nascending to descend to reascend\\nthe old man seriously took his bearings\\nand spoke his doubts in every open place\\n\\nwe came out on a lookoff where we faced\\na cliff and on the cliff a bottle painted\\nor stained by vegetation from above\\na likeness to surprise the thrilly tourist\\n\\nwell if i havent brought you to the fountain\\nat least ive brought you to the famous bottle\\n\\ni wont accept the substitute its empty\\n\\nsos everything\\n\\ni want my fountain\\n\\ni guess youd find the fountain just as empty\\nand anyway this tells me where i am\\n\\nhadnt you long suspected where you were?\\n\\nyou mean miles from that mormon settlement?\\nlook here you treat your guide with due respect\\nif you dont want to spend the night outdoors\\ni vow we must be near the place from where\\nthe two converging slides the avalanches\\non marshall look like donkeys ears\\nwe may as well see that and save the day\\n\\ndont donkeys ears suggest we shake our own?\\n\\nfor gods sake arent you fond of viewing nature?\\nyou dont like nature all you like is books\\nwhat signify a donkeys cars and bottle\\nhowever natural? give you your books!\\nwell then right here is where i show you books\\ncome straight down off this mountain just as fast\\nas we can fall and keep abouncing on our feet\\nits hell for knees unless done hellforleather\\n\\nbe ready i thought for almost anything\\n\\nwe struck a road i didnt recognize\\nbut welcomed for the chance to lave my shoes\\nin dust once more we followed this a mile\\nperhaps to where it ended at a house\\ni didnt know was there it was the kind\\nto bring me to for broadboard paneling\\ni never saw so good a house deserted\\n\\nexcuse me if i ask you in a window\\nthat happens to be broken davis said\\nthe outside doors as yet have held against us\\ni want to introduce you to the people\\nwho used to live here they were robinsons\\nyou must have heard of clara robinson\\nthe poetess who wrote the book of verses\\nand had it published it was all about\\nthe posies on her inner windowsill\\nand the birds on her outer windowsill\\nand how she tended both or had them tended\\nshe never tended anything herself\\nshe was shut in for life she lived her whole\\nlife long in bed and wrote her things in bed\\nill show you how she had her sills extended\\nto entertain the birds and hold the flowers\\nour business firsts up attic with her books\\n\\nwe trod uncomfortably on crunching glass\\nthrough a house stripped of everything\\nexcept it seemed the poetesss poems\\nbooks i should say! if books are what is needed\\na whole edition in a packing case\\nthat overflowing like a horn of plenty\\nor like the poetesss heart of love\\nhad spilled them near the window toward the light\\nwhere driven rain had wet and swollen them\\nenough to stock a village library\\nunfortunately all of one kind though\\nthey bad been brought home from some publisher\\nand taken thus into the family\\nboys and bad hunters had known what to do\\nwith stone and lead to unprotected glass\\nshatter it inward on the unswept floors\\nhow had the tender verse escaped their outrage?\\nby being invisible for what it was\\nor else by some remoteness that defied them\\nto find out what to do to hurt a poem\\nyet oh! the tempting flatness of a book\\nto send it sailing out the attic window\\ntill it caught wind and opening out its covers\\ntried to improve on sailing like a tile\\nby flying like a bird silent in flight\\nbut all the burden of its body song\\nonly to tumble like a stricken bird\\nand lie in stones and bushes unretrieved\\nbooks were not thrown irreverently about\\nthey simply lay where someone now and then\\nhaving tried one had dropped it at his feet\\nand left it lying where it fell rejected\\nhere were all those the poetesss life\\nhad been too short to sell or give away\\n\\ntake one old davis bade me graciously\\n\\nwhy not take two or three?\\n\\ntake all you want\\ngoodlooking books like that he picked one fresh\\nin virgin wrapper from deep in the box\\nand stroked it with a hornyhanded kindness\\nhe read in one and i read in another\\nboth either looking for or finding something\\n\\nthe attic wasps went missing by like bullets\\n\\ni was soon satisfied for the time being\\n\\nall the way home i kept remembering\\nthe small book in my pocket it was there\\nthe poetess had sighed i knew in heaven\\nat having eased her heart of one more copy\\nlegitimately my demand upon her\\nthough slight was a demand she felt the tug\\nin time she would be rid of all her books\\n\\na neighbor of mine in the village\\nlikes to tell how one spring\\nwhen she was a girl on the farm she did\\na childlike thing\\n\\none day she asked her father\\nto give her a garden plot\\nto plant and tend and reap herself\\nand he said why not?\\n\\nin casting about for a corner\\nhe thought of an idle bit\\nof walledoff ground where a shop had stood\\nand he said just it\\n\\nand he said that ought to make you\\nan ideal onegirl farm\\nand give you a chance to put some strength\\non your slimjim arm\\n\\nit was not enough of a garden\\nher father said to plow\\nso she had to work it all by hand\\nbut she dont mind now\\n\\nshe wheeled the dung in a wheelbarrow\\nalong a stretch of road\\nbut she always ran away and left\\nher notnice load\\n\\nand hid from anyone passing\\nand then she begged the seed\\nshe says she thinks she planted one\\nof all things but weed\\n\\na hill each of potatoes\\nradishes lettuce peas\\ntomatoes beets beans pumpkins corn\\nand even fruit trees\\n\\nand yes she has long mistrusted\\nthat a ciderapple\\nin bearing there today is hers\\nor at least may be\\n\\nher crop was a miscellany\\nwhen all was said and done\\na little bit of everything\\na great deal of none\\n\\nnow when she sees in the village\\nhow village things go\\njust when it seems to come in right\\nshe says i know!\\n\\nits as when i was a farmer\\noh never by way of advice!\\nand she never sins by telling the tale\\nto the same person twice\\n\\nto think to know the country and now know\\nthe hillside on the day the sun lets go\\nten million silver lizards out of snow!\\nas often as ive seen it done before\\ni cant pretend to tell the way its done\\nit looks as if some magic of the sun\\nlifted the rug that bred them on the floor\\nand the light breaking on them made them run\\nbut if i though to stop the wet stampede\\nand caught one silver lizard by the tail\\nand put my foot on one without avail\\nand threw myself wetelbowed and wetkneed\\nin front of twenty others wriggling speed\\nin the confusion of them all aglitter\\nand birds that joined in the excited fun\\nby doubling and redoubling song and twitter\\ni have no doubt id end by holding none\\n\\nit takes the moon for this the suns a wizard\\nby all i tell but sos the moon a witch\\nfrom the high west she makes a gentle cast\\nand suddenly without a jerk or twitch\\nshe has her speel on every single lizard\\ni fancied when i looked at six oclock\\nthe swarm still ran and scuttled just as fast\\nthe moon was waiting for her chill effect\\ni looked at nine the swarm was turned to rock\\nin every lifelike posture of the swarm\\ntransfixed on mountain slopes almost erect\\nacross each other and side by side they lay\\nthe spell that so could hold them as they were\\nwas wrought through trees without a breath of storm\\nto make a leaf if there had been one stir\\none lizard at the end of every ray\\nthe thought of my attempting such a stray!\\n\\nwhen i go up through the mowing field\\nthe headless aftermath\\n   smoothlaid like thatch with the heavy dew\\n half closes the garden path\\n\\n   and when i come to the garden ground\\nthe whir of sober birds\\n up from the tangle of withered weeds\\n is sadder than any words\\n\\na tree beside the wall stands bare\\n but a leaf that lingered brown\\n   disturbed i doubt not by my thought\\n comes softly rattling down\\n\\n i end not far from my going forth\\n   by picking the faded blue\\nof the last remaining aster flower\\n to carry again to you\\n\\nthe linestorm clouds fly tattered and swift\\n the road is forlorn all day\\nwhere a myriad snowy quartz stones lift\\n and the hoofprints vanish away\\nthe roadside flowers too wet for the bee\\n expend their bloom in vain\\ncome over the hills and far with me\\n and be my love in the rain\\n\\nthe birds have less to say for themselves\\n in the woodworlds torn despair\\nthan now these numberless years the elves\\n although they are no less there\\nall song of the woods is crushed like some\\n wild earily shattered rose\\ncome be my love in the wet woods come\\n where the boughs rain when it blows\\n\\nthere is the gale to urge behind\\n and bruit our singing down\\nand

rainfresh goldenrod\\n\\noh never this whelming east wind swells\\n but it seems like the seas return\\nto the ancient lands where it left the shells\\n before the age of the fern\\nand it seems like the time when after doubt\\n our love came back amain\\noh come forth into the storm and rout\\n and be my love in the rain\\n\\nto ridgely torrence\\non last looking into his hesperides\\n\\ni often
